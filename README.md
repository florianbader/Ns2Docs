```
If no source directories are supplied, Ns2Docs will try to automatically find the Natural Selection installation directory by searching the registry.

```
Ns2Docs-Console.exe -generator Json -out "C:\Natural Selection 2\docs.json" "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\natural selection 2" "c:\My Mod"
```
This will parse any files with names ending in .lua that are found in either *C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\natural selection 2* or *c:\My Mod*. The output will be a Json file that will gets written to *C:\Natural Selection 2\docs.json*.

###Generating Static Html Files

Ns2Docs-Console.exe
```

####Changing The Output Folder

```
Ns2Docs-Console.exe -out "C:\Natural Selection 2\docs"
```
The static html files will be written to *C:\Natural Selection 2\docs* instead of the default *ns2docs*.

###Generating Json Files

```
Ns2Docs-Console.exe -generator Json
```

####Changing The Output File
```
Ns2Docs-Console.exe -out "C:\Natural Selection 2\docs.json"
```
The Json file will be written to *C:\Natural Selection 2\docs.json* instead of *out.json*.
